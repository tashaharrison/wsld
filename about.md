## Who Said Latin's Dead?

### A beginners' course for Common Entrance Latin

The course aims to be engaging, rigorous and interactive, a blend of traditional and modern approaches.
It is not a textbook; rather, a series of workbooks with a single narrative throughout. There are three levels, as per the Common Entrance syllabus, and each level is divided into four workbooks covering the required vocabulary and grammar.

The style and format have been designed with children and young people in mind. The narrative has been crafted to capture, but not limit, its studentsâ€™ imaginations.

Each chapter opens with a translation, following the adventures of the two main characters, Guy and Olivia. A grammar point is introduced, along with a variety of activities to develop understanding and build confidence. There is also a list of vocabulary to be learned, a comprehension, a second translation, and an extension section with puzzles and prose composition for the more able.

Although the course is aimed at pupils preparing for Common Entrance Latin, it will also be perfectly suitable for beginners in primary schools, secondary schools, or self-taught students.
